Components
-------------------

First of all we have to split out task into small pieces: components.
User part:
* Header (static)
* Footer (static)
* Left menu with top recipe sections
* Left menu with holiday sections
* List of recipes
* Pager

Admin part:
* List of holidays (ability to add new, edit or remove)
* List of recipes (TODO )
* Recipe finder
* 

Also we have to deal with routes (optional).
